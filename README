This repository contains tools to analyze and model infrastructure capacity.

Requirements:
- Setup up a virtualenv with python3.5
- pip install aiohttp

My basic flow is something like this, for example calculating various metrics
for our OSX 10.10 testers (called t-yosemite-r7-XXX) since February 1, 2016:

1) Grab upstream data since February 1st, filter by our naming pattern,
   compress and save:

    python get_data.py --from 2016-02-01 | grep t-yosemite-r7 | gzip > t-yosemite-r7.log.gz

2) Look at wait time metrics for the real historical data.

    zcat t-yosemite-r7.log.gz | python calc_waits.py

3) Look at build-to-build metrics from the historical data. You'll need
   these numbers to plug into the wait time simulator

    zcat t-yosemite-r7.log.gz | python calc_b2btime.py

4) Strip out just the job request time / duration information.

    zcat t-yosemite-r7.log.gz | python get_jobs.py| gzip > t-yosemite-r7.jobs.gz

5) Run the wait time simulator.

    zcat t-yosemite-r7.jobs.gz| python simulate_waits.py -b 200 -n 198

   This says to simulate the wait times for 198 machines (-n 198) given a
   200s minimum delay between jobs (-b 200; the build-to-build time calculated
   by calc_b2btime.py)
